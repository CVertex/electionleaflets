        <p>
            The Straight Choice is an real-time election leaflet project.
        </p>
        <p>
        <p>
            Our ambition is to create a live visualization of the flood of party political leaflets as they are delivered across the country during an election campaign.

            If you have recently received any election leaflets through your door you can help by photographing or scanning them and <a href="{$www_server}/addupload.php">uploading the images to our server</a>.
        </p>

            The idea was conjured up in December 2008 at a weekend in Derbyshire, and 
            finally acted upon in Francis's front living room in Cambridge at the end of April 2009. You can read about where the name for this website came from <a href="http://blog.thestraightchoice.org/2009/04/whats-in-the-name-the-straight-choice/">here</a>.

        <h3>The team</h3>
        <p>
            This website has been put together by 
            three of the usual suspects who don't have time or contacts to sell ideas or 
            apply for grants.

            <strong>Julian Todd</strong> had the job of pestering people about an election leaflet monitoring website
            after discovering just how crucially important these pieces of paper really are.  
            In 2003 he wrote <a href="http://www.publicwhip.org.uk">Public Whip</a> with Francis Irving, 
            which became the input for mySociety's <a href="http://theyworkforyou.com">TheyWorkForYou.com</a>.  
            In 2007 he made <a href="http://www.undemocracy.com">UNdemocracy.com</a> which applied the same 
            idea to the United Nations General Assembly and Security Council.

            <strong>Richard Pope</strong> spent a couple of days <a href="http://code.google.com/p/theelectionleafletproject/">writing the code for this site</a> and making it look pretty.
            He is the brains behind the <a href="http://www.planningalerts.com">Planning Alerts</a> project, <a href="http://www.groupsnearyou.com">Groups Near You</a> and <a href="http://www.streetwire.org">StreetWire</a>.
            In 2005 he made the <a href="http://www.electionmemory.com">Election Memory project</a> to record and publicise 
            manifestos of the different parties in the Lambeth local elections.
